    "\n",
    "This is a follow-up to the `media_topics_structured_output.ipynb` notebook that demonstrated AI 'auto-tagging' using the IPTC Media Topics controlled vocabulary and the Google Gemini API. Here, we take tagging in a new direction by using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. We'll use the same Media Topics vocabulary, but will store embeddings of the terms in a vector database.\n",

    "Since we found there to be a limit on the number of enum values an AI can be structured to output, we will dynamically load the relevant vocabulary.\n",

    "The anger is palpable. It is the anger of the craftsman watching the factory rise. It is the defense of \"sweat equity.\" The belief that art must be difficult, that the soul leaks onto the canvas only through physical exhaustion.\n",
    "But this picket line is being walked sixty years too late.\n",
    "The definition of art was not broken by a tech bro in Silicon Valley in 2024. It was dismantled, piece by piece, in the lofts of New York City in the 1960s. A group of artists called Fluxus already severed the hand from the tool. They taught us that the art is not in the execution.\n",
    "The art is in the choice.\n",
    "The Prompt is just a Score (George Brecht)\n",
    "Critics argue that typing a text prompt isn't creating. You are just giving orders.\n",
    "In 1961, George Brecht wrote a piece titled Word Event. The entire artwork consisted of one word: \"EXIT.\"\n",
    "That was it. The viewer had to enact it. The \"score\" was a set of instructions; the reality was the rendering. When you type “imagine a red cube” into Midjourney, you are not cheating. You are writing a Fluxus Event Score. You provide the code; the machine provides the rendering. Brecht realized that the artist is not the builder. The artist is the architect of the situation.\n",
    "The Machine plays itself (Joe Jones)\n",
    "\"But the machine does all the work!\" they shout. \"You don't even know how to hold a brush.\"\n",
    "Joe Jones, the \"Music Machine Man,\" didn't hold a violin bow. He built mechanical orchestras; violins fitted with motors, drums beaten by rubber bands. He opened the Tone Deaf Music Store in 1969, where the public could push a button and make the art happen.\n",
    "Jones removed the virtuoso. He proved that music wasn't about the dexterity of fingers on a fretboard; it was about the organization of sound. AI removes the illustrator. It asks: is art the movement of the wrist, or the organization of the pixel?\n",
    "The Idea is the Engine (Sol LeWitt)\n",
    "The most damning accusation against AI is that it is \"lazy.\" It bypasses the struggle.\n",
    "Sol LeWitt, the father of Conceptual Art, handed us the defense decades ago: \"The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.\"\n",
    "LeWitt would write instructions for wall drawings—\"Draw a line from the left corner to the center\"—and let assistants execute them. He never touched the wall. Was he lazy? No. He understood that authorship lies in the concept, not the carpentry. If LeWitt can claim the wall drawn by an assistant, the modern creator can claim the image drawn by the algorithm. The assistant has simply changed from carbon to silicon.\n",
    "Silence is just Latent Space (John Cage)\n",
    "Finally, there is the fear that AI is just rearranging old data. That it is random noise.\n",
    "John Cage sat at a piano for 4 minutes and 33 seconds and played nothing. He framed the silence. He forced the audience to listen to the ambient noise of the room and called it music.\n",
    "An AI model is infinite noise. It is a \"latent space\" of chaos. The artist’s job is no longer to apply paint. The artist's job is to frame the noise. To reach into the chaos and pull out a specific moment of clarity. Selection is creation.\n",
    "The Verdict\n",
    "Anthropologist Ellen Dissanayake calls art \"making special.\" It is the act of taking the ordinary and making it significant.\n",
    "If a user types \"cat\" and posts it, they have made nothing special. That is a cheap signal. But the creator who wrestles with the prompt, who curates the output, who forces the machine to visualize a new reality—they are walking the path paved by Fluxus.\n",
    "The anger you feel is real. It is the pain of a paradigm shift. But do not blame the software.\n",
    "The ghost in the machine isn't a thief. It's just the spirit of 1960s avant-garde, finally accessible to everyone.\n",
    "The brush is dead. Long live the idea.\n",
